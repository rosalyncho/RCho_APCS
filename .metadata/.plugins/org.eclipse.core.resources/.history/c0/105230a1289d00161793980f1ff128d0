		//It's a method that acts on a string, <StringName>.split(<String sp>);
		//Where sp is the string where the string splits
		//And it returns an array
		// Example: "I like apples!".split(" "); 
		//		it will split at spaces and return an array of ["I","like","apples!"]
		// Example 2: "I really like really red apples"split("really")
		//		it will split at the word "really" and return an array of ["I "," like "," apples!"]
		
		//play around with String.split! what happens if you "I reallyreally like apples".split("really") ?

		//Your task:
		/*Write a method that take in a string like "applespineapplesbreadlettustomatobaconmayohambreadcheese" describing a sandwich
		 * use String.split to split up the sandwich by the word "bread" and return what's in the middle of the sandwich and ignores what's on the outside
		 * What if it's a fancy sandwich with multiple pieces of bread?

		 * use String.split to split up the sandwich at the spaces, " ", and return what's in the middle of the sandwich and ignores what's on the outside
		 * Again, what if it's a fancy sandwich with multiple pieces of bread?
